# Biologically Inspired Computing

An introduction to self-adapting methods also called artificial intelligence or machine learning. Schemes for classification, search and optimisation based on bio-inspired mechanisms are introduced. This includes evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks and more specialised approaches like e.g. swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems.
